# Pregui

Atmospheric Minigame 

Pregui is an old lady who lives happily in her little house in the forest. She has everything very tucked up and he really likes to have flowers in his window vase. So he goes out into the woods and picks a few flowers, the ones he likes, the mixture he likes, and comes home and puts them in his window vase, and she feels happy.

The idea of the game is to create a relaxing, unhurried, almost meditative experience. There is no other objective that feeling the pleasure of walking through the forest in a monotonous way, in a very soft mental mood. With some short and separated in time moments of mini action which are just bending over to pick a flower.
